#The create_lr_for_acas.py script relies on an up-to-date ldclient library.
#To install, first download the ldclient from the LD server that is paired with this ACAS server using:
#wget https://relevant-ld-server.onschrodinger.com/livedesign/ldclient.tar.gz
#Then unpack the war and make a symlink as follows:
#tar -zxf ldclient.tar.gz
#ln -s ldclient-version-build/ldclient ldclient
