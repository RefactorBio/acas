###
  This subsystem runs processes, most likely an R script, on a periodic basis to check the status of an external system or process.
  Examples of uses:
- Check the status of external data analysis jobs running on a grid system
- Check for files that need to be processed newly added to a directory
- Check to see if ACAS should send a user a reminder to do something, for example that a term in a contract document is about to occur
- Kick off ping-pong table generator

Basic requirements:
- Programmatically add and remove periodic jobs
- Call R script (in future other languages)
- When called, there will be no context, so function names and arguments need to be strings or numbers, not live functions.
- Queue has to survive system ACAS and server reboots, so should be stored permanently in the database or a file
- Need to be able to configure jobs as well as launch them programmatically.
  A module like doc manager should be able to specify jobs to run in a config file in its source, or maybe a global config.
  I guess we could make the module have to add it if doesnâ€™t exist when it is first run
  (maybe in the setup routes function?) We would need to add a module for ping-pong
